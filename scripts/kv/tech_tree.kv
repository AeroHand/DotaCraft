	// Treat buildings as Tech that can be destroyed
	// These abilities will show on the builder at all points, but as a disabled version that states the requirements if some of them aren't met.
	// To avoid having to search the building every time, each building will run a script on created/destroyed, to keep track of the current tech
	// The script will compare the requirements for any ability that mentions the created/destroyed unit, and update all builders accordingly.
	// Requirements aren't recursive, meaning if A is a requirement for B and B is a requirement for C, destroying A won't make you unable to build C as long as B is up.

	// Tech Upgrade abilities are hidden once they are researched
	// Each time a unit spawns it should check for its upgrades. 
	// Each time an upgrade is finished, it should go through all the units and apply it.
